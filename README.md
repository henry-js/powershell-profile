Repo to automate most of my Powershell profile setup.

(Note, the large Windows background above is my desktop wallpaper, the profile background is in the bottom-right to distinguise before Windows and Linux sessions)

Will install Oh-My-Posh, set as prompt & install theme, Powershell profile with config for PSReadLine, Z, Terminal Icons, Nerd Fonts (glyphed), Windows Terminal settings. PSReadLine config from @shanselman.

Clone repo and run install.ps1 - that's it (shell restart may be needed for all changes to come into effect)
