Repo to automate most of my Powershell profile setup.

![PS](https://i.imgur.com/rMu15Tk.gif)

Will install Oh-My-Posh, set as prompt & install theme, Powershell profile with config for PSReadLine, Z, Terminal Icons, Nerd Fonts (glyphed), Windows Terminal settings. PSReadLine config from @shanselman.

Clone repo and run install.ps1 - that's it (shell restart may be needed for all changes to come into effect).
